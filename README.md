The javascript SDK provides client-side functionalities for adding embedded app to the Copper web client.

The Embedded app is an iframe embedded in the Copper web page. The display location of the iframe is configured in the embedded app's settings page.

## Usage
Execute the following with your webpack/rollup/browserify etc.
```bash
yarn add copper-sdk
# or
npm install copper-sdk --save
```

Followed by:
```javascript
import Copper from 'copper-sdk';
const sdk = Copper.init();

sdk.getContext()
  .then(({ context }) => {
    // do something with the context
  });
```
